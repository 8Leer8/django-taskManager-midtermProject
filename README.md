# django-taskManager-midtermProject
Setup:
1st u must put in terminal "pipenv install django" then type "django-admin startproject task_manager ." adter that create a new app by typing "python manage.py startapp tasks". Since i will be using postgresql we should download pyscopg2 by typing "pip install psycopg2" to install to your local computer, this is required since it's a adapter for our database which is postgresql. Now u will edit the settings in project level, put in installed apps the name of the app "tasks" then edit the database to your own database after that create a new folder in app level named "templates" and add a new file name urls to be able to access the files on templates folder. add import include on urls of project level so that it can redirect to our app
Creating a model for my app to migrate it to the database, after creating the model migrate your model by typing on the terminal "python manage.py makemigrations" then "python manage.py migrate"
after that u can now edit the templates and views file to insert and fetch data from the database
